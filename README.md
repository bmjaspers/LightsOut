Lights Out! was an electronic game released by Tiger in the mid-90s.

This replicates the functionality of the game using AngularJS, and also offers the chance to try on larger grid sizes. 

When you press a button, it toggles the state of the button pressed and the buttons directly surrounding it. The goal is to turn all of the lights off.
